# Rackula — Product Roadmap

Single source of truth for version planning.

---

## Version Philosophy

- **Incremental releases** — Each version is usable and complete
- **Scope discipline** — Features stay in their designated version
- **Spec-driven** — No implementation without spec
- **User value** — Each release solves real problems
- **Single rack focus** — One rack per project, no multi-rack complexity
- **Minimalism** — Keep it simple and focused
- **Consistency** — Design and behaviour should be consistent across the app
- **Accessibility** — Ensure usability for all users, including those with disabilities

---

# Roadmap Considerations

---

## High-Priority: Brand-Specific Device Libraries

**Demand signal**: 6+ upvotes, multiple mentions, competitor promised "next release"

**Requested brands**:

- **Ubiquiti** — Homelab darling, UniFi ecosystem
- **Mikrotik** — Power user favourite, RouterOS

### Priority: Option B — Curated Starter Packs

Based on existing starter library research (2025-12-11), we already have an approved 27-item generic library. The next step is brand-specific packs.

**Ubiquiti Starter Pack** (target: 15-20 devices):

- USW-Pro-24, USW-Pro-48 (switches)
- USW-Pro-24-PoE, USW-Pro-48-PoE (PoE switches)
- USW-Aggregation (10GbE)
- UDM-Pro, UDM-SE (gateway/controller)
- UNVR, UNVR-Pro (NVR)
- USP-PDU-Pro (power)
- Cloud Key Gen2+

**Mikrotik Starter Pack** (target: 15-20 devices):

- CRS326-24G-2S+ (most popular switch)
- CRS328-24P-4S+ (PoE switch)
- CRS309-1G-8S+ (10GbE switch)
- CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS (router)
- RB5009UG+S+IN (router)
- netPower series

**Effort**: Low-Medium — manual curation, leverage existing research
**Source images**: NetBox device-type library has many of these

### Future: Option A — NetBox Device-Type Library Integration

- Thousands of pre-defined devices at [netbox-community/devicetype-library](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library)
- Already using NetBox-compatible schemas
- Could import/convert on demand
- **Defer until after brand starter packs prove the model**

### Performance Consideration: On-Demand Loading

If bundled brand packs cause performance issues (app size, load time), consider:

- **On-demand download** — User clicks "Download Ubiquiti Pack" → fetches from CDN
- **Data bundled, images lazy-loaded** — Device definitions included, images fetched on first view
- **Trigger:** Revisit if total bundle exceeds ~2MB or load time exceeds 3s on slow connections

**Note**: Patch panels (24-port, 48-port) and cable management (brush panel, cable management) already in approved library.

---

### Export UX Overhaul

**Current state**: PNG and SVG export exist but output quality is rough

**Issues to address**:

- Visual polish of exported images
- Layout/composition improvements
- Filename conventions
- Preview before export

**Additional formats to consider**:

- CSV (for inventory/spreadsheet users)
- NetBox import format (ecosystem integration)

**Effort**: Medium — UX design review + implementation refinement

---

## Research / Considerations (Future)

### UPS/PDU Enhancements

**Current state**: Basic 1U PDU, 2U UPS, 4U UPS in library

**Initial scope (v0.7)**:

- `outlet_count` — Number of outlets (e.g., 8, 12, 16)
- `va_rating` — VA capacity (e.g., 1500, 3000)

**Future considerations**:

- `watt_rating` — Often derived from VA, could auto-calculate
- `outlet_type` — NEMA 5-15, C13, C19 (enum or string)
- `runtime_minutes` — Runtime at load (requires load calculation system)
- Brand-specific models: APC Smart-UPS, CyberPower, Tripp Lite, Eaton

**Representative models from research**:

- APC SMT1500RM2U, SMT2200RM2U (most common)
- CyberPower PR series (budget alternative)

**Effort**: Low-Medium
**Priority**: Medium — enhances existing functionality

---

### NAS/Storage Visual Fidelity

**Current state**: Generic 1U/2U/4U Storage in library

**Potential enhancements**:

- Drive bay visualisation (3.5" vs 2.5")
- Bay count property (4-bay, 8-bay, 12-bay, etc.)
- Drive status indicators (future)

**Popular models from research**:

- Synology RS819 (1U, 4-bay)
- Synology RS1221+ (2U, 8-bay)
- QNAP TS-832PXU (2U)

**Effort**: Medium (visual rendering work)
**Priority**: Medium — improves visual accuracy

---

### Specific Chassis/Enclosure Support

**Demand signal**: "Rosewill rack chassis" mentioned in thread

**Approach**:

- Don't model every chassis brand
- Support generic chassis types with common form factors
- Allow custom naming ("My Rosewill RSV-L4500U")
- Consider case/chassis as a device category

**Common homelab cases**:

- Rosewill RSV-L4500 series
- iStarUSA cases
- Silverstone RM series

**Effort**: Low — mostly labelling and category
**Priority**: Low-Medium

---

### Multiple Racks

**Status**: On existing roadmap, deferred from earlier scope reduction
**Competitor**: Also on their roadmap, not shipped

**Considerations**:

- Data model already supports rack arrays
- UI complexity is the challenge
- Most homelabbers have 0-1 racks (validated in scope reduction)

**Effort**: High (coordinate transforms, multi-canvas, or different approach)
**Priority**: Low — address after core single-rack experience is polished

---

### Wishlist / Shopping List Feature

**Competitor roadmap item**: "wishlist"

**Concept**:

- Mark devices as "planned" vs "installed"
- Visual differentiation (opacity, border style, badge)
- Generate shopping list export
- Budget tracking (if prices added)

**Effort**: Medium (new state per device, UI for toggle, export logic)
**Priority**: Low — nice-to-have, not core functionality

---

## Messaging/Positioning Notes

When launching publicly, emphasise:

1. **"Engineered with 1400+ tests"** — Directly addresses "will this die in a year" skepticism from thread

2. **"NetBox-compatible"** — Appeals to "NetBox is too heavy but I want the data model" crowd

3. **"Self-hostable today"** — Ahead of competitor's roadmap

4. **"Open source"** — Transparency they don't offer

5. **"Same AI tools, different discipline"** — Honest about vibe coding, but the TDD difference matters

---

## Suggested Prioritisation

### Next Release (v0.6?)

- [ ] **[R-01]** Curated Ubiquiti starter pack (15-20 devices)
- [ ] **[R-02]** Curated Mikrotik starter pack (15-20 devices)

### Following Release (v0.7?)

- [ ] **[R-03]** Export UX overhaul (PNG/SVG quality + design review)
- [ ] **[R-04]** CSV export format
- [ ] **[R-05]** UPS/PDU property enhancements

### Backlog / Research

- [ ] **[R-06]** NetBox device-type library browser/import
- [ ] **[R-07]** NAS/Storage visual fidelity (drive bays)
- [ ] **[R-08]** Chassis/enclosure category
- [ ] **[R-09]** Multiple racks
- [ ] **[R-10]** Wishlist/planned state
- [ ] **[R-11]** Community device contribution workflow
- [ ] **[R-12]** NetBox export format
- [ ] **[R-13]** Runtime/power calculations

---

## Infrastructure Considerations

### Analytics Setup

**Requirement**: Privacy-respecting analytics for usage insights

**Recommended**: Umami

- Self-hosted, open source
- GDPR compliant, no cookies
- Lightweight (~2KB script)

**Hosting options**:

A. **Cloudflare + Linode VPS**

- Linode VPS runs Umami + potentially other services
- Cloudflare proxy for DDoS protection, caching, SSL
- Estimated cost: ~$5-10/mo Linode Nanode/Shared
- Benefit: Full control, can add other services later

B. **Umami Cloud**

- Managed hosting from Umami team
- Free tier: 10K events/month
- Less infrastructure to manage
- Trade-off: dependency on third party

C. **Railway/Fly.io**

- Container hosting with free tiers
- Simpler than managing a VPS
- May have cold start issues on free tier

**Recommendation**: Option A (Cloudflare + Linode) for long-term flexibility

**Infrastructure TODO** **[R-14]**:

- [ ] Provision Linode VPS (Nanode or Shared 1GB)
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare proxy for VPS
- [ ] Deploy Umami via Docker
- [ ] Configure Umami for Rackula domain
- [ ] Add tracking script to app (respect DNT header)

---

#### Phase 3: Placement Image Overrides (Planned) **[R-15]**

Per-placement image overrides with stable IDs:

- [ ] Add `id: string` (UUID) field to PlacedDevice type
- [ ] Generate UUID on device placement
- [ ] Refactor ImageStore for two-level storage
- [ ] Update archive format for device-types/ + placements/
- [ ] Add image override UI to EditPanel
- [ ] Auto-process user uploads (400px + WebP)

---

## Outstanding Issues

> **Process:** For each issue, create a branch, write a spec with test cases, implement using TDD.
> Mark with `[x]` only when complete.

## Research

### [RES-01] Device Palette DnD Menu Patterns

**Status:** Open
**Priority:** High
**Created:** 2025-12-13

**Problem:** DevicePalette sidebar with CollapsibleSection accordion causes scroll/visibility issues. When multiple sections are expanded, bottommost items in sections become inaccessible. Removing sticky positioning did not resolve the issue.

**Research Questions:**

1. How do other Svelte 5 apps implement sidebar menus with drag-and-drop sources?
2. What patterns exist for collapsible sections in scrollable containers?
3. Would a tab-based approach (one section visible at a time) work better than accordion?
4. How do design systems (Radix, shadcn-svelte, Melt UI) handle this?

**Reference Examples to Investigate:**

- [ ] shadcn-svelte Accordion component
- [ ] Melt UI Collapsible/Accordion
- [ ] Bits UI (Svelte 5 headless components)
- [ ] Svelte DnD Action library patterns
- [ ] Figma plugin panel patterns (similar use case)
- [ ] VS Code sidebar/explorer patterns

**Potential Solutions:**

1. **Tab-based sections** — Only one brand visible at a time (Generic | Ubiquiti | Mikrotik tabs)
2. **Virtual scrolling** — Only render visible items in long lists
3. **Fixed-height sections** — Each section has max-height with internal scroll
4. **Drawer per section** — Click section header to open full-screen drawer
5. **Search-first UX** — Collapse all by default, rely on search to find devices

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Document 3+ reference implementations
- [ ] Prototype preferred approach
- [ ] Verify drag-and-drop works correctly with chosen pattern
- [ ] All devices in all sections accessible via scroll or navigation

---

## Out of Scope

Features that will **not** be implemented:

- Multiple racks per project
- Backend/database
- User accounts (without cloud sync feature)
- Internet Explorer support
- Native mobile apps

---

## Considerations but Not Doing

Features that were considered but explicitly deferred or rejected.

### NetBox On-Demand Fetch (Deferred)

Fetch device images on-demand from the NetBox Device Type Library:

- Search/browse UI for NetBox library
- Fetch from `raw.githubusercontent.com` (CORS-friendly)
- Cache fetched images locally
- Assign fetched images to device types or placements

**Reason for deferral:** The bundled images + user upload approach covers immediate user needs without network dependency. On-demand fetch adds complexity (UI for search/browse, network error handling, caching) that can be evaluated later based on user feedback. May revisit if users frequently request specific device images not in the starter library.

---

## Process

### Adding Features to Roadmap

1. Add to **Backlog** with brief description
2. When prioritizing, assign a priority number in Future Roadmap
3. Before implementation, update spec-combined.md
4. Implement following TDD methodology

### Version Graduation

```
Backlog → Future Roadmap → Planned (current) → Released
```
